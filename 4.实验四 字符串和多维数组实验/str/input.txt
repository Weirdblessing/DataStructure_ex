Autopilot - Egil Olsen
Going around in circles
It's starting to show
I guess I should at least be concerned or somethin'
But nobody's home
I'm on autopilot
Staring blank into space
I'm on autopilot
These days
Feel's like I've been going nowhere
For the last two or three years
I wish I would at least be scared or somethin'
But nobody's here
I'm on autopilot
Empty look on my face
I'm on autopilot
These days
I'm on autopilot
Drifting into the haze
I'm on autopilot
These days
